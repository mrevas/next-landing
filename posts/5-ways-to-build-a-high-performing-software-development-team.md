Do not get in their way

Power their strong points and permit them to give their best and don't try to change them. If they make mistake once, keep an eye on their work to ensure that they don't repeat it. Recurrent errors become part of the culture and are not easy to eliminate.

You may have hired top-notch developers for your team but it is not enough because with incompetent leadership you can drop your A-Level team to the C-level performing team. Even if you are not a born leader, you can manage to be a good leader in your business. You can begin with directing your desire for your company.\
